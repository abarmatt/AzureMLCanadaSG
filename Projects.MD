Lee Francis | 07/26/2020 | -

Lee has been scraping Twitter data on many interesting and controversial political issues in Alberta. The issues include
* COVID policy reactions
* Education reform

She has proposed running different types ML techniques on the data including
* Sentiment Analysis
* Textual Analysis

Two datasets of ~160K tweets each. First is related to public education in Alberta. Big spikes recently with the government's announcement that schools will be fully re-opened with few restrictions and no additional funding for covid safeguards. Second dataset relates to the ongoing and quite vicious twitter war between our provincial government and the province's physicians. Lots of spikes and, just today, the Alberta Medical Association announced the results of their members vote on confidence in the provincial minister of health. 97% have no faith in the minister.

David Lau | 07/26/2020 | -

David has proposed using ML to look into the effects of corporate fundamentals from 10-k reports and other sources to see if they have predicative power over a firms financial and stock performance.

This project provides a good opportunity to work on your feature engineering skills as many features will need to be constructed (financial ratios like debt-to-equity, book-to-market, etc..)

Brianna, our resident lawyer, has proposed a very interesting project to analyze the text of legal decisions to see if we models can be built that may be able to
* Predict outcome of cases
* Help firms decide which cases are worth allocating resources too
* Automate basic and repetitive legal tasks

From the website:
_The automatic identification system (AIS) is a tracking system for ships, originally developed for collision avoidance. The data is automatically transmitted every few seconds over very high frequency (VHF) radios from approximately 100,000 vessels worldwide. Allowing for real-time geo-tracking and identification for equipped vessels, the AIS data promises to map and describe certain marine human activities. AIS data provides a big data source of unrivaled quality above and beyond its original application for collision avoidance.

The number of possible applications for this data is enormous, and we believe that it could also be used to support official statistics in monitoring the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and to assist the world in its fight against climate change. To quickly utilize the data to its full potential, we need a surge of creative researchers to come up with equally creative ways to use it!_
